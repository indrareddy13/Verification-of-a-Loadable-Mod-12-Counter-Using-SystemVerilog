# Verification-of-a-Loadable-Mod-12-Counter-Using-SystemVerilog

Created a robust SystemVerilog testbench environment to verify a loadable Mod-12 counter RTL design. The counter supports multiple features, including synchronous load, reset, and mod-12 counting functionality. Developed a stimulus generator to apply various test cases, such as loading specific values, validating the mod-12 wrap-around behavior, and testing the counter under corner-case scenarios. Implemented a scoreboard for automated output checking to ensure the correctness of count values during normal and boundary operations. Achieved 100% functional coverage, verifying all possible counter states and transitions to ensure accurate counting and reliable operation.
